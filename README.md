# A-Comprehensive-RFM-Customer-Churn-Analysis

## Project Summary

This project focuses on performing an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on the Online Retail II dataset to understand customer purchasing behavior and identify potential customer segments for retention strategies. The data includes transactions from a UK-based online retailer selling unique gift items between December 2009 and December 2011.
Using K-Means, the project segments customers based on their RFM scores, providing insight into churn risk and customer value tiers. The final model helps in identifying key customer groups.
